Limitations of AI
- Performance
- Explainability
- Biased through biased data
- Adversarial attacks on AI

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bias**
How does AI learn to be biased?
-Learns stereotypes on internet


Why bias matters?
- Hiring tool discriminates against women
- Facial recognition working better for light-skinned than dark-skinned individuals
- Bank loan approvals

**Adversarial attacks**

Attempt to make the AI to do something it wasnt designed to do. Tricking the AI system.
- Changing pixel values
- Physical attacks (wearing certain glasses, stickers)

Adversarial defenses

**Adverse uses of AI**

DeepFakes
Undermining of democracy and privacy(oppressive surveillance)
Generating fake comments
Spam vs anti-spam  fraud vs anti-fraud

**AI and developing economies**

AI could automate lower end jobs.
AI could help developing economies by leapfrogging them to skip the developing steps to get to a certain point of development.

**How developing economies can build AI**

Focus on AI to strengthen a county's vertical industries. (Use AI for what your country needs)
Public- Private partnerships to accelerate development
Invest in education
